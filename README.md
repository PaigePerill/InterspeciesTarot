Boxset Making Instructions 



This documentation describes the making of a box for holding a deck of cards and a booklet. 
When the box opens, a Voice will describe the context of the object and why it needs to exist. 

The deck of cards and booklet are tied to my Project with Carolina called the Interpecies Tarot. It is a tarot deck that illustrates and poses the crucial questions we need to ask ourselves when working with other species to act more in alignment. By using the tarot format, we can go into detail about each concept card in the booklet, while the cards remain evocative images. This works well for the project because we can expand on complex subjects in written form, while still staying engaging and playful yet still including a mix of scientific concepts, poetic storytelling and references. 

Because the content is not entirely ready yet, the voice recording part of this project is a good addition, since it can be a placeholder until the content is ready (cards+booklet), yet still intrigue and inspire the audience. 


Step 1: 
Define how the box will be made. 

I had orginally thought of laser cutting various pieces of plywood with the lasercutter and assembling them together, however Edu suggested I instead CNC the slots shapes into a large block of wood. We went to see the available wood in the scrap pile and found a thick piece of white oak wood that fit the brief perfectly.
